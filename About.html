    <h3> Allow Me To introduce Myself</h3>
    <p1>Hello! First and foremost I am overjoyed to have you visit my page. My name is Sarah Tabor but my friends call me Tabez, prounounced "Tay-bzzz", you can use whichever you're most comfortable with.</p1>
    <p2>My mom had six children, four girls and one boy, obviously her greatest child was her second born &#128514; </p2>
    <p3>
        My dogs and cat are my whole world. We have a pit-blueheeler mix, she's 4, a mini aussie, he will be 3 in September, and a toy aussie, he's 1. Our cat is the sweetest old lady, she is 8.
        My girlfriend and I enjoy spending our free time with them in the back yard, especially on pool days even though only one pup truly enjoys the pool haha. We love to travel and try new things, dog friendly places are top tier. I enjoy videogames when I am not with them, PS4 is the console I prefer and I'll add my PSN down at the bottom for any
        interested Call of Duty players who need a fourth!
        PSN: @tabez_ &#128520;
